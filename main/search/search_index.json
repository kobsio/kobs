Notes Please read the following notes, before you start with the development of your own plugins: Adding a plugin to the kobsio/kobs repository: When you want to create a plugin, which should be added as official plugin to the kobsio/kobs repository, create a new issue first . The issue should contain a description for the plugin you want to develop and an explanation why it makes sens to add it as official plugin. Maintaining a plugin in your own repository: If you develop a public plugin in your own repository you can use the kobsio/plugin-template . Besides that it would be nice to add a markdown file for your plugin to the docs/community-plugins folder. You can also add a kobs-plugin label so that users can find your plugin via GitHub. Private plugins: For private plugins you can also use the kobsio/plugin-template . Structure Each plugin contains a backend and a frontend part.

NewRouter (), } return router , nil } A complete example can be found in the following file https://github.com/kobsio/plugin-template/blob/main/cmd/helloworld.go . Frontend Code The frontend code for plugins uses our fork of Create React App to support Module Federation. Each plugin must export three modules: Instance , Page and Panel . These modules are configured in the setupModuleFederation.js file. The Instance module is used to display a card on the plugins page. The component receives the properties defined in the IPluginInstance interface from the @kobsio/shared : export interface IPluginInstance { id: string; satellite: string; type: string; name: string; description?: string; options?: IPluginInstanceOptions; updatedAt: number; } export interface IPluginInstanceOptions { [key: string]: any; } import React from 'react'; import { IPluginInstance, PluginInstance } from '@kobsio/shared'; import { defaultDescription } from '../../utils/constants'; import icon from '../../assets/icon.png'; const Instance: React.FunctionComponent<IPluginInstance> = ({ satellite, name, type, description, }: IPluginInstance) => { return ( <PluginInstance satellite={satellite} name={name} type={type} description={description || defaultDescription} icon={icon} /> ); }; export default Instance; The Page module is used to display a dedicated page for a plugin, when a user selects the plugin instance on the plugins page. The component receives the plugin instance as property. export interface IPluginPageProps { instance: IPluginInstance; } To have a unified look across all plugins, we recommend to use a PageHeaderSection and PageContentSection component. import { Card, CardBody } from '@patternfly/react-core'; import React from 'react'; import { IPluginPageProps, PageContentSection, PageHeaderSection, PluginPageTitle } from '@kobsio/shared'; import { defaultDescription } from '../../utils/constants'; const Page: React.FunctionComponent<IPluginPageProps> = ({ instance }: IPluginPageProps) => { return ( <React.Fragment> <PageHeaderSection component={ <PluginPageTitle satellite={instance.satellite} name={instance.name} description={instance.description || defaultDescription} /> } /> <PageContentSection hasPadding={true} hasDivider={true} toolbarContent={undefined} panelContent={undefined}> <Card isCompact={true}> <CardBody>{JSON.stringify(instance)}</CardBody> </Card> </PageContentSection> </React.Fragment> ); }; export default Page; The Panel module is used to display a plugin within a dashboard. The component receives the properties defined in the IPluginPanelProps interface from the @kobsio/shared package. export interface IPluginPanelProps { title: string; description?: string; options?: any; instance: IPluginInstance; times?: ITimes; setDetails?: (details: React.ReactNode) => void; } You can create a custom interface which extends the IPluginPanelProps interface, so that you can define the options for your plugin. Please always validate the options passed to your plugin, since we can not validate them with the Custom Resource Definition. import React from 'react'; import { IPluginPanelProps, PluginPanel, PluginPanelError } from '@kobsio/shared'; interface IHelloWorldPluginPanelProps extends IPluginPanelProps { options?: any; } const Panel: React.FunctionComponent<IHelloWorldPluginPanelProps> = ({ title, description, options, instance, times, setDetails, }: IHelloWorldPluginPanelProps) => { if (options) { return ( <PluginPanel title={title} description={description}> <div> <div>{JSON.stringify(options)}</div> <div>{JSON.stringify(instance)}</div> <div>{JSON.stringify(times)}</div> <div>{JSON.stringify(setDetails)}</div> </div> </PluginPanel> ); } return ( <PluginPanelError title={title} description={description} message=\"Options for HelloWorld panel are missing or invalid\" details=\"The panel doesn't contain the required options to get data from HelloWorld.\" documentation=\"https://kobs.io/main/community-plugins/helloworld\" /> ); }; export default Panel; A complete example can be found in the kobsio/plugin-template repository within the following files: https://github.com/kobsio/plugin-template/blob/main/src/setupModuleFederation.js https://github.com/kobsio/plugin-template/blob/main/src/components/instance/Instance.tsx https://github.com/kobsio/plugin-template/blob/main/src/components/page/Page.tsx https://github.com/kobsio/plugin-template/blob/main/src/components/panel/Panel.tsx Use your Plugin To use your created plugin you can use the kobsio/app-template repository.

This comes with a lot of necessary configuration and security concerns. Decision Drivers If there is a multi-cluster setup (e.g. to implement multi-tenancy) and e.g. for security reasons it is not possible to expose the data sources one have to run a kobs instance for every Kubernetes cluster. As a result, there is no one place to centrally access observability data. Considered Options Central instance access data from other Kubernetes clusters via KubeAPI Rework architecture and introduce an in-cluster component Decision Outcome Chosen option: \"Rework Architecture\", because expose KubeAPI and provide a .kubeconfig comes with security concerns.

We recommend to run kobs behind a service like OAuth2 Proxy , which should handle the authentication of users. Permissions If the authentication / authorization middleware for kobs is enabled via the --auth.enabled flag, we use the value from the --auth.header.user and --auth.header.teams header to authorize the user to access a plugin or Kubernetes resource. These headers should be set by a service like the OAuth2 Proxy like it is shown in the following examples. The values from the headers are then used to get a User CR or a Team CR . If the user is part of multiple teams or when the permissions are set via the User CR and the Team CR, we merge all the permissions, so that the user can access all plugins and resources which are allowed for the user / teams. Examples The following two examples show how you can setup kobs with an OAuth2 Proxy infront using the NGINX Ingress Controller or Istio . Before you are looking into the examples, make sure you have setup your prefered OAuth Provider .

The `details` microservice contains book information. * `reviews`. The `reviews` microservice contains book reviews. It also calls the `ratings` microservice. * `ratings`. The `ratings` microservice contains book ranking information that accompanies a book review. There are 3 versions of the `reviews` microservice: * Version v1 doesn't call the `ratings` service. * Version v2 calls the `ratings` service, and displays each rating as 1 to 5 black stars. * Version v3 calls the `ratings` service, and displays each rating as 1 to 5 red stars.

Usage Permissions You can define fine grained permissions to access your Azure resources via kobs. The permissions are defined via the permissions.plugins[].permissions field of a User or Team . The team membership of an user is defined via the values of the X-Auth-Request-Groups header. In the following example each member of team1@kobs.io will get access to all Azure resource, while members of team2@kobs.io can only access container instances in the development resource group: team1 --- apiVersion : kobs.io/v1 kind : Team metadata : name : team1 spec : group : team1@kobs.io permissions : plugins : - satellite : \"*\" name : \"*\" type : \"*\" - satellite : \"*\" name : \"azure\" type : \"azure\" permissions : - resources : - \"*\" resourceGroups : - \"*\" verbs : - \"*\" team2 --- apiVersion : kobs.io/v1 kind : Team metadata : name : team2 spec : group : team1@kobs.io permissions : plugins : - satellite : \"*\" name : \"*\" type : \"*\" - satellite : \"*\" name : \"azure\" type : \"azure\" permissions : - resources : - \"containerinstances\" resourceGroups : - \"development\" verbs : - \"*\" The * value is a special value, which allows access to all resources, resource groups and action. The following values can also be used for resources and verbs: resources : containerinstances , kubernetesservices and monitor verbs : delete , get , post and put Note You have to set the permissionsEnabled property in the configuration to true and you must enable authentication for kobs to use this feature. Metrics kobs supports all Azure metrics for the supported services. To get a list of all metric names and there aggregation types one of the following commands can be used: Container Instances: az monitor metrics list-definitions --resource /subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION>/resourceGroups/<RESOURCE-GROUP>/providers/Microsoft.ContainerInstance/containerGroups/<CONTAINER-GROUP> Kubernetes Services: az monitor metrics list-definitions --resource /subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION>/resourceGroups/<RESOURCE-GROUP>/providers/Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/<MANAGED-CLUSTER> Virtual Machine Scale Sets: az monitor metrics list-definitions --resource /subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION>/resourceGroups/<RESOURCE-GROUP>/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets/<VIRTUAL-MACHINE-SCALE-SET> Virtual Machine Scale Sets (Virtual Machine): az monitor metrics list-definitions --resource /subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION>/resourceGroups/<RESOURCE-GROUP>/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets/<VIRTUAL-MACHINE-SCALE-SET>/virtualMachines/<VIRTUAL-MACHINE> In the returned JSON array you can check the name.value fields for the metric names and the supportedAggregationTypes for all the supported aggregation types of a metric.

Usage Query String Syntax The Elasticsearch plugins uses the query string syntax for filtering log lines. Field Names You can specify fields to search in the query syntax: where the status field contains active status:active where the title field contains quick or brown title:(quick OR brown) where the author field contains the exact phrase \"john smith\" author:\"John Smith\" where the first name field contains Alice (note how we need to escape the space with a backslash) first\\ name:Alice where any of the fields book.title , book.content or book.date contains quick or brown (note how we need to escape the * with a backslash): book.\\*:(quick OR brown) where the field title has any non-null value: _exists_:title Wildcards Wildcard searches can be run on individual terms, using ? to replace a single character, and * to replace zero or more characters: qu?ck bro* Regular Expressions Regular expression patterns can be embedded in the query string by wrapping them in forward-slashes ( \"/\" ): name:/joh?n(ath[oa]n)/ Fuzziness We can search for terms that are similar to, but not exactly like our search terms, using the \"fuzzy\" operator: quikc~ brwn~ foks~ Ranges Ranges can be specified for date, numeric or string fields.

Displayed on the page is a description of the book, book details (ISBN, number of pages, and so on), and a few book reviews. The Bookinfo application is broken into four separate microservices: * `productpage`. The `productpage` microservice calls the `details` and `reviews` microservices to populate the page. * `details`. The `details` microservice contains book information. * `reviews`. The `reviews` microservice contains book reviews. It also calls the `ratings` microservice. * `ratings`. The `ratings` microservice contains book ranking information that accompanies a book review. There are 3 versions of the `reviews` microservice: * Version v1 doesn't call the `ratings` service. * Version v2 calls the `ratings` service, and displays each rating as 1 to 5 black stars. * Version v3 calls the `ratings` service, and displays each rating as 1 to 5 red stars.

Note Ensure that the satellite has enough permissions to retrieve all these resources from the Kubernetes API server. If you are using the Helm chart or Kustomize to install kobs, it will automatically create the correct Cluster Role and Cluster Role Binding, so that you can view, but not edit all these resources. On the Kubernetes Resources page in kobs you can view all the resources available in you clusters. You can filter the list by clusters, namespaces and resources. You can also specify a label or field selector. By selecting an item in the table, you can view more details for this resource. All the details can be found in the overview tab. If you want to view the Yaml representation of the resource you can select the corresponding tab. Next to the yaml representation, you find a second tab events, which shows all events, which are related to the selected object. The events are retrieved with a field selector and the name of the resource: fieldSelector=involvedObject.name=<NAME-OF-THE-RESOURCE> . Actions kobs provides several actions for all Kubernetes resources. These actions can be found in the upper right corner in the details view next to the close icon. For each resource it is possible to edit and delete the selected resource. Next to these default actions, kobs also has some other actions for some resources: Scale Deployments, StatefulSets and ReplicaSets ( kubectl scale --replicas=3 deployment/bookinfo ) Restart DaemonSets, Deployments and StatefulSets ( kubectl rollout restart deployment bookinfo ) Trigger a CronJob manually ( kubectl create job --from=cronjob/backup backup-manual-qg0qjf ) View the logs of a Pod ( kubectl logs productpage-v1-55fb45c999-c8bvg ). Get a shell into a Pod ( kubectl exec -it productpage-v1-55fb45c999-c8bvg -c istio-proxy -- bash ). Dashboards You can specify a list of dashboards for your Kubernetes resources, to get additional information. For example you can add a dashboard to a Pod to get the resource usage metrics from Prometheus or you can add a dashboard to a Deployment to view all the logs from Elasticsearch for this Deployment. The dashboards can be configured via the kobs.io/dashboards annotation. They follow the same syntax as they can be configured for applications , users and teams . You can use JSONPath within the dashboar dspecification, to use a value from the reosurce manifest in the dashboard, e.g. the name of the Pod <% $.metadata.name %> . Note We are using the jsonpath-plus to extract the content from the Kubernetes objects. A list of examples can be found within the documentation of the module. In the following example we are adding the istio-http dashboard to the productpage-v1 deployment and the resource-usage dashboard to the pods of the deployment.
