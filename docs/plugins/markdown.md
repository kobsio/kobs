                The application displays information about a
                book, similar to a single catalog entry of an online book store. Displayed
                on the page is a description of the book, book details (ISBN, number of
                pages, and so on), and a few book reviews.

                The Bookinfo application is broken into four separate microservices:

                * `productpage`. The `productpage` microservice calls the `details` and `reviews` microservices to populate the page.
                * `details`. The `details` microservice contains book information.
                * `reviews`. The `reviews` microservice contains book reviews. It also calls the `ratings` microservice.
                * `ratings`. The `ratings` microservice contains book ranking information that accompanies a book review.

                There are 3 versions of the `reviews` microservice:

                * Version v1 doesn't call the `ratings` service.
                * Version v2 calls the `ratings` service, and displays each rating as 1 to 5 black stars.
                * Version v3 calls the `ratings` service, and displays each rating as 1 to 5 red stars.

                The end-to-end architecture of the application is shown below.

                This application is polyglot, i.e., the microservices are written in different languages.
                Itâ€™s worth noting that these services have no dependencies on Istio, but make an interesting
                service mesh example, particularly because of the multitude of services, languages and versions
                for the `reviews` service.
