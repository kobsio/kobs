# Getting Started

Community plugins are plugins, which are not part of the kobsio/kobs repository. They are developed and maintained by our awsome community to extend kobs with new functions.

In the following you can find a list of community plugins. If you developed your own plugin feel free to add it to the list below.

!!! note
    You can add a new file with the documentation for your plugin to the `docs/community-plugins` folder. Just create a new markdown file with the name of your plugin and link it in the `mkdocs.yml` file in the root directory of this repository.
