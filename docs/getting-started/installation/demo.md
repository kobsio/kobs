# Demo

The kobs demo can be used to try out the kobs. Within the demo you will deploy [Istio](https://istio.io) via the [Istio Operator](https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/install/operator/), [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io), [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud-on-k8s/current/k8s-quickstart.html), [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io), [Kiali](https://kiali.io) and the [Bookinfo Application](https://istio.io/latest/docs/examples/bookinfo/).

## Create a Kubernetes Cluster using Kind

The demo uses [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io) to create a local Kubernetes cluster, to deploy the mentioned services.

!!! note
    If you are using [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/), please check the minikube and Istio documentation to expose kobs and the Bookinfo Application to access them via your browser.

To create a Kubernetes cluster using kind your can run the [`kind-with-registry.sh`](https://github.com/kobsio/kobs/blob/main/deploy/demo/kind-with-registry.sh) script. The script will create a kind cluster with one node, configures a local Docker registry and sets the correct port mappings, so that you can access kobs via your browser later.

```sh
deploy/demo/kind-with-registry.sh
```

When your cluster is ready, you should see the following message:

```txt
Creating cluster "kobs-demo" ...
 ‚úì Ensuring node image (kindest/node:v1.19.1) üñº
 ‚úì Preparing nodes üì¶
 ‚úì Writing configuration üìú
 ‚úì Starting control-plane üïπÔ∏è
 ‚úì Installing CNI üîå
 ‚úì Installing StorageClass üíæ
Set kubectl context to "kind-kobs-demo"
You can now use your cluster with:

kubectl cluster-info --context kind-kobs-demo
```

To use the cluster you can switch your `kubectl` context using `kubectl cluster-info --context kind-kobs-demo`.

## Install all Services

Now we can deploy all the CRDs for kobs, the [metrics-server](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server) and the [kube-state-metrics](https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics):

```sh
kustomize build deploy/kustomize/crds | kubectl apply -f -
kustomize build deploy/demo/kube-system | kubectl apply -f -
```

Now we can deploy all resources for the `istio-operator` and `istio-system` namespace. We are using Istio to get some nice Prometheus metrics for the Bookinfo Application and for the integration with Jaeger to get some traces. To install the Operator and Istio run the following commands, this will also deploy Prometheus, Jaeger and Kiali in the `istio-system` namespace:

```sh
kustomize build deploy/demo/istio-operator | kubectl apply -f -
kustomize build deploy/demo/istio-system | kubectl apply -f -
```

When Istio is up and running, we can install Elasticsearch and Filebeat to collect the logs for the Bookinfo Application and kobs to have all our observability tools in one UI:

```sh
kustomize build deploy/demo/kobs/main | kubectl apply -f -
```

The above commands are also installing kobs, with the `incluster` provider and the correct configuration for the Prometheus, Elasticsearch and Jaeger plugin. The complete configuration file looks as follows:

```yaml
clusters:
  providers:
    - provider: incluster
      incluster:
        name: kobs-demo

plugins:
  prometheus:
    - name: prometheus
      displayName: Prometheus
      description: "From metrics to insight: Power your metrics and alerting with a leading open-source monitoring solution."
      address: http://prometheus.istio-system.svc.cluster.local:9090

  elasticsearch:
    - name: elasticsearch
      displayName: Elasticsearch
      description: "A distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine capable of addressing a growing number of use cases."
      address: http://elasticsearch-es-http.elastic-system.svc.cluster.local:9200

  jaeger:
    - name: jaeger
      displayName: Jaeger
      description: "Open-source, end-to-end distributed tracing: Monitor and troubleshoot transactions in complex distributed systems"
      address: http://tracing.istio-system.svc.cluster.local:80/jaeger
```

The last step, befor you can explore the functions of kobs, is to install the Bookinfo Application. The application displays information about a book, similar to a single catalog entry of an online book store. Displayed on the page is a description of the book, book details (ISBN, number of pages, and so on), and a few book reviews. To deploy the application run the following command:

```sh
kustomize build deploy/demo/bookinfo | kubectl apply -f -
```

If all components were installed correctly you can run `kubectl get pods -A` to get a list of all Pods. The output should look similar to the following:

```txt

## Access kobs and the Bookinfo Application

If you want to access kobs and the Bookinfo Application via your browser, you have to add the following entries to your `/etc/hosts` file:

```txt
127.0.0.1 kobs.demo
127.0.0.1 bookinfo.demo
```

After you have adjusted the hosts file, you can open [http://bookinfo.demo/productpage](http://bookinfo.demo/productpage) in your browser. You should see the productpage for the Bookinfo Application. When you refresh the page, the reviews section of the page should change with every request. To generate some traffic to get more metrics, logs and traces you can run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
while :; do curl -s "http://bookinfo.demo/productpage" | grep -o "<title>.*</title>"; sleep 1; done
```

Now you can take a look at kobs. Open [http://kobs.demo](http://kobs.demo) to view the kobs frontend. You should see the home page with the five items:

- **Applications:** Is the section to view all applications, which are define via the Application CRD.
- **Resources:** Can be used to view all Kubernetes resources, like Deployments, Pods, StatefulSets and Custom Resources.
- **Prometheus:** Is the page for the Prometheus plugin, which can be used to directly query the configured Prometheus instance.
- **Elasticsearch:** Can be used to retrieve the logs of the Pods via the Elasticsearch plugin.
- **Jaeger:** View the traces of the Bookinfo Application via the Jaeger plugin.

Let's focus on the **Applications** section for this demo. When you select the `bookinfo` namespace you should see four applications: [details](https://github.com/kobsio/kobs/blob/main/deploy/demo/bookinfo/details-application.yaml), [productpage](https://github.com/kobsio/kobs/blob/main/deploy/demo/bookinfo/productpage-application.yaml), [rating](https://github.com/kobsio/kobs/blob/main/deploy/demo/bookinfo/rating-application.yaml) and [reviews](https://github.com/kobsio/kobs/blob/main/deploy/demo/bookinfo/reviews-application.yaml). You can click on the links to view the corresponding Application CR.

## Cleanup

To delete the created Kubernetes cluster and the local Docker registry, when you are done with the demo, you can run the following commands. This will delete the kind cluster and the Docker container for the local Docker registry:

```sh
kind delete cluster --name kobs-demo
docker stop kind-registry
docker rm kind-registry
```
