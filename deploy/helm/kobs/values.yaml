  ## Specify security settings for the kobs Container. They override settings made at the Pod level via the
  ## "podSecurityContext" when there is overlap.

  ## We usually recommend not to specify default resources and to leave this as a conscious choice for the user. This
  ## also increases chances charts run on environments with little resources, such as Minikube. If you do want to
  ## specify resources, uncomment the following lines, adjust them as necessary, and remove the curly braces after

  ##
  settings:

## Enable the Envoy sidecar. This is required, because kobs uses gRPC Web for the API requests and Envoy translates the
## HTTP requests from the frontend into gRPC requests.
## The Envoy sidecar can be disabled, when you handle the gRPC requests at another level, e.g. Ingress.
